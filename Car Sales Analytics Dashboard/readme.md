## ‚ö° DAX Formulas Explained

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ New_Categ (Sales Type Classification)**

```DAX
New_Categ =
VAR cate = New_Category[Category]
VAR _type = SWITCH(
    cate,
    "Office Supplies", "Direct Sale",
    "Technology", "Third Party",
    "Furniture", "Pre Book"
)
RETURN _type
```

## Sales Transaction Classification

This formula categorizes sales transactions based on the product category:

- **Office Supplies** ‚Üí Direct Sale
- **Technology** ‚Üí Third Party
- **Furniture** ‚Üí Pre-Book

This classification helps in filtering and segmenting the sales data for detailed insights.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Seg (Customer Segment Classification)**

```
Seg =
VAR cate = New_City[Segment]
VAR _type = SWITCH(
    cate,
    "Consumer", "Replacement",
    "Home Office", "Other",
    "Corporate", "Servicing"
)
RETURN _type
Explanation:
This formula categorizes customer types into three segments:

```

## Customer Segmentation Formula

This formula categorizes customer types into three segments:

- **Consumer** ‚Üí Replacement Sales
- **Home Office** ‚Üí Other Sales
- **Corporate** ‚Üí Servicing Sales

This helps in analyzing which customer segment contributes the most to overall sales.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Category_Switch (Custom Category Mapping)**

```
Category_Switch =
VAR cate = SELECTEDVALUE(Orders[Category])
VAR \_type = SWITCH(
TRUE(),
cate = "Office Supplies", "Digital Watch",
cate = "Furniture", "Analog Watch",
cate = "Technology", "Other"
)
RETURN \_type
```

## Product Category Renaming

This formula renames product categories to make them more intuitive:

- **Office Supplies** ‚Üí Digital Watch
- **Furniture** ‚Üí Analog Watch
- **Technology** ‚Üí Other

This helps in providing a more user-friendly representation of categories in reports.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ YTD_Sales (Year-to-Date Sales Calculation)**

```
Current_year_sales =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Orders[Sales]),
    DATESYTD(Orders[Order Date])
)
```

## Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales Calculation

This formula calculates the total sales for the current year up to today‚Äôs date.

- Uses **DATESYTD()** to filter orders from the beginning of the year.
- Helps track how sales are progressing in real time.
  Sales_growth =

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Sales_growth (Year-over-Year Sales Growth)**

```
DIVIDE(
    ([Current_year_sales] - [Previous_year_sales]),
    [Previous_year_sales]
)
```

This formula calculates sales growth compared to the previous year in percentage.

- **Positive value** ‚Üí Indicates sales have increased.
- **Negative value** ‚Üí Indicates sales have decreased.

This metric helps in understanding overall business performance and trends.
